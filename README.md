This application downloads all intermediate CA certificates for a given SSL server certificate. It can help you fix the *incomplete certificate chain* issue, also reported as *Extra download* by [Qualys SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).

See Releases for prebuilt binaries or build it yourself.

NOTE: In case of any troubles with Go you can try the deprecated shell script in [shell](https://github.com/zakjan/cert-chain-resolver/tree/shell) branch.

## Usage

```

## Background

![Incomplete certificate chain](images/incomplete-chain.png)

All operating systems contain a set of default trusted root certificates. But CAs usually don't use their root certificate to sign customer certificates. Instead of they use so called intermediate certificates, because they can be rotated more frequently.

A certificate can contain a special *Authority Information Access* extension ([RFC-3280](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3280)) with URL to issuer's certificate. Most browsers can use the AIA extension to download missing intermediate certificate to complete the certificate chain. This is the exact meaning of the *Extra download* message. But some clients (mobile browsers, OpenSSL) don't support this extension, so they report such certificate as untrusted.

A server should always send a complete chain, which means concatenated all certificates from the certificate to the trusted root certificate (exclusive, in this order), to prevent such issues. Note, the trusted root certificate should not be there, as it is already included in the systemâ€™s root certificate store.

You should be able to fetch intermediate certificates from the issuer and concat them together by yourself, this script helps you automatize it by looping over certificate's AIA extension field.

## Docker Version
For those that don't have go installed there's a docker version that can be built as well, the following instructions will allow you to build a docker container mount the cert directory and create the full chain.
### Build Docker Image
```
docker build . -t cert-chain-resolver:latest
```
### Run Docker Image
```
docker run -v `pwd`:/certs cert-chain-resolver:latest -o /certs/domain.bundle.pem /certs/dominain.pem
```
### Other implementations

* [deprecated shell script](https://github.com/zakjan/cert-chain-resolver/tree/shell) (shell)
* [https://certificatechain.io/](https://certificatechain.io/) (webservice)
* [freekmurze/ssl-certificate-chain-resolver](https://github.com/freekmurze/ssl-certificate-chain-resolver) (PHP)
